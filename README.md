# Intro-to-Data-Analytics-Project
## Summary
I was assigned the role of a data analyst for a fictional Gaming Company. The task was to conduct a descriptive analysis of a video game dataset in order to gain insights into how the company's new games could perform in the market. The intended audience for this project was the executives of GameCo. The analysis focused on historical data of video game sales in North America, the European Union, and Japan. The dataset was obtained from VG Charts and the analyst cleaned the data and created visualizations to present their findings and insights.
## Data Analytics/Hypothesis
The current understanding of GameCo's marketing strategy is that the 3 regions (NA,EU, and JP) have maintained consistent sales each year; thus, the marketing budget has remained steady.
Based on the line graph created in my presentation, the data suggests that each region has substantially changed in its global sales proportion over time.
Based on the bar graphs created in my presentation, some insights I discovered was that Japan sales exceed the European Union and North America region in the Role-Playing genre and that the Playstation 4 was the top grossing console in 2016.
## Recommendation
Based on the data analysis, several recommendations can be made regaring each region. In the North American market, its global proportion has decreased over time compared to the other regions. I reccommended to allocate fewer marketing resources due to its decline.
In the European Union market, the region has shown to have a steady interest growth over time, and I reccommend to allcoate more marketing resources for the upcoming year. 
Although Japan has historically been the lowest proportioned region in global sales, it has a potential for a sudden growth due to the Playstation 4 being a Japanese console and grossing the highest sales in 2016. I reccommend to monitor trends and new rleeases by Japanese game developers and create marketing campaigns accordingly.
