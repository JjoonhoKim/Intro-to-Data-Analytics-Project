# Intro-to-Data-Analytics-Project
For this project, I was asked to be a data analyst for a pseudo Gaming Company and asked to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCoâ€™s new games might fare in the market. In this project, I understood the business problem, grouped and summarized data, formulated hypotheses, used data to (dis)confirm those hypotheses, and visualized and presented the insights.
