# Intro-to-Data-Analytics-Project
## Summary
For this project, I was asked to be a data analyst for a pseudo Gaming Company and asked to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCoâ€™s new games might fare in the market. 
The objective of my project was to find insights using historical data and giving reccommendations for the marketing budget in the coming up year. 
## Data Analytics/Hypothesis
The current understanding of GameCo's marketing strategy is that the 3 regions have maintained consistent sales each year; thus, the marketing budget has remained steady.
Based on the line graph created in my presentation, the data suggests that each region has substantially changed in its global sales proportion over time.
Based on the bar graphs created in my presentation, some insights I discovered was that Japan sales exceed the European Union and North America region in the Role-Playing genre and that the Playstation 4 was the top grossing console in 2016.
## Recommendation
Based on the data analysis, several recommendations can be made regaring each region. In the North American market, its global proportion has decreased over time compared to the other regions. I reccommended to allocate fewer marketing resources due to its decline.
In the European Union market, the region has shown to have a steady interest growth over time, and I reccommend to allcoate more marketing resources for the upcoming year. 
Although Japan has historically been the lowest proportioned region in global sales, it has a potential for a sudden growth due to the Playstation 4 being a Japanese console and grossing the highest sales in 2016. I reccommend to monitor trends and new rleeases by Japanese game developers and create marketing campaigns accordingly.
