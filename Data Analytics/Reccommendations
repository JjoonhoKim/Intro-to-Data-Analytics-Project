Based on the data analysis, several recommendations can be made regaring each region. In the North American market, its global proportion has decreased over time compared to the other regions. I reccommended to allocate fewer marketing resources due to its decline.
In the European Union market, the region has shown to have a steady interest growth over time, and I reccommend to allcoate more marketing resources for the upcoming year. 
Although Japan has historically been the lowest proportioned region in global sales, it has a potential for a sudden growth due to the Playstation 4 being a Japanese console and grossing the highest sales in 2016. I reccommend to monitor trends and new rleeases by Japanese game developers and create marketing campaigns accordingly.
