The current understanding of GameCo's marketing strategy is that the 3 regions have maintained consistent sales each year; thus, the marketing budget has remained steady. The objective of my project was to find insights using historical data and giving reccommendations for the marketing budget in the coming up year. 
Based on the line graph created in my presentation, the data suggests that each region has substantially changed in its global sales proportion over time.
Based on the bar graphs created in my presentation, some insights I discovered was that Japan sales exceed Europe and North America in the Role-Playing genre and that the Playstation 4 was the top grossing console in 2016.
