For my Introduction to Data Analytics Project, my audience for this project were the GameCo executives who are looking for insights utilizing historical data on video game sales based on specific regions, specifically North America, Europe, and Japan. 
The current understanding of GameCo's marketing strategy is that the 3 regions have maintained consistent sales each year; thus, the marketing budget has remained steady. The objective of my project was to find insights using historical data and giving reccommendations for the marketing budget in the coming up year.
