For my Introduction to Data Analytics Project, my audience for this project were the GameCo executives who are looking for insights utilizing historical data on video game sales based on specific regions, specifically North America, European Union, and Japan. The data set was sourced externally from VG Charts where I cleaned the data and created visuals that supported my insights and findings.
